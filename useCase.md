# Use Case: Enhanced Small Object Detection in Road/Parking Lot Surveillance
**Scenario:**

The city's traffic management authority wants to improve their surveillance system for road safety and parking lot monitoring. They aim to detect and track small objects such as license plates, pedestrians, and vehicles accurately and efficiently in real-time.

**Solution:**

Integrating YOLOv8 with SAHI for sliced interference offers an innovative approach to enhance small object detection in CCTV surveillance systems.

**Implementation Steps:**

- Data Collection and Preparation: Gather a diverse dataset of road and parking lot scenes captured by CCTV cameras. Annotate the dataset with bounding boxes for small objects like license plates, pedestrians, and vehicles.
- Model Training: Train the YOLOv8 model using the annotated dataset. Fine-tune the model using SAHI techniques, which involve slicing the input images into overlapping patches during both training and inference stages. This ensures better detection of small objects by providing larger pixel areas for them.
- Integration with CCTV System: Integrate the trained YOLOv8 with SAHI model into the existing CCTV surveillance system deployed across roads and parking lots.
- Object Detection and Tracking: Detect and track small objects such as license plates, pedestrians, and vehicles in real-time. The system accurately identifies and locates these objects within the surveillance footage, providing valuable insights for traffic management and security purposes.
- Alerts and Notifications: Implement an alerting system to notify authorities of any suspicious activities or violations detected, such as unauthorized parking or traffic violations captured by the surveillance system.

**Benefits:**

- Improved Accuracy: YOLOv8 with SAHI enables more accurate detection of small objects by providing larger pixel areas, enhancing their visibility within the surveillance footage.
- Real-time Processing: The integrated solution offers real-time analysis of CCTV video feeds, allowing for prompt response to any security or traffic-related incidents.
- Enhanced Security: By accurately detecting and tracking small objects, the surveillance system enhances security measures on roads and parking lots, deterring criminal activities and ensuring public safety.

**Conclusion:**

By leveraging YOLOv8 with SAHI for sliced interference, the city's traffic management authority can significantly enhance their CCTV surveillance system's capabilities for small object detection in road and parking lot scenarios. This advanced solution not only improves security measures but also facilitates more efficient traffic management and enforcement of regulations.
